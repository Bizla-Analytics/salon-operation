# Private test VPS: dev branch, no domain or S3

If using the new public test domain, follow
[Caddy HTTPS with local backups](test-https-deployment.md) instead. The old
`local-preview` mode remains SSH-only; `https-local` is the explicit new option.

This is an **optional dev-only preview**, not public production hosting.
`main`, its HTTPS/secure-cookie requirements and mandatory encrypted off-server
backup workflow are unchanged. Use synthetic test records, not company/customer
data. Local backups survive container replacement but **not loss of the VPS or
its disk**. Copy important backups to another machine until off-site storage is ready.

## 1. Your existing runner

You already installed the Ubuntu runner service and Docker. No second runner or
manual repository clone is needed. In GitHub **Settings → Actions → Runners**,
select this test runner and add the custom label **`salonops-test`**. It must also
have the normal `self-hosted`, `Linux`, `X64` labels. Never label it
`salonops-production`.

On Ubuntu, as `ubuntu`:

```bash
cd ~/actions-runner
sudo ./svc.sh status
docker version
docker compose version
sudo install -d -o ubuntu -g ubuntu -m 700 /etc/salonops
sudo install -d -o ubuntu -g ubuntu -m 750 /opt/salonops-dev
sudo install -d -o ubuntu -g ubuntu -m 700 /var/lib/salonops-dev/backups
```

This path needs Bash, coreutils, `flock` and host `python3` (normally present on
Ubuntu). Keep Docker current; Docker releases before 28 have a localhost-publish
security caveat. Do not enable custom Docker direct-routing/routed networks.
Restrict inbound SSH to your IP in the VPS security group/firewall. **Do not open
8000 or 5432 publicly** and do not add a public reverse proxy for this preview.
See [Docker port-publishing guidance](https://docs.docker.com/engine/network/port-publishing/).

## 2. Generate the private configuration once

Run this on **Ubuntu**, not local Windows. It creates fresh secrets without
printing them. It refuses to overwrite an existing file. If the file already
exists, investigate first; changing DB passwords in `.env` does not change a
role password in an already-initialized PostgreSQL volume.

```bash
python3 - <<'PY'
import os
import secrets

path = '/etc/salonops/dev.env'
fd = os.open(path, os.O_WRONLY | os.O_CREAT | os.O_EXCL, 0o600)
with os.fdopen(fd, 'w') as config:
    config.write('SECRET_KEY=' + secrets.token_hex(64) + '\n')
    config.write('POSTGRES_PASSWORD=' + secrets.token_hex(32) + '\n')
    config.write('POSTGRES_ADMIN_PASSWORD=' + secrets.token_hex(32) + '\n')
print('Created /etc/salonops/dev.env; secret values were not printed.')
PY
stat -c '%a %U %n' /etc/salonops/dev.env
```

Expected permissions: `600 ubuntu /etc/salonops/dev.env`. **Do not paste the file
contents into chat, Git, Actions variables, logs or screenshots.** The example
`deploy/preview.env.example` documents the three secrets, but all runtime settings
are forced in standalone `compose.preview.yaml`: `DEBUG=False`, localhost hosts,
private HTTP, no proxy-header trust, restricted DB user, and no public database
port. Bootstrap-admin credentials are never passed to the web container.

The fixed Compose project is `salonops-dev`, DB `salonops_dev`, app role
`salonops_dev_app`, persistent volume **`salonops-dev-pgdata`**. Never reuse an
existing production volume or rename this volume after first deployment.
The HTTP cookies deliberately cannot use the browser's `Secure` flag for
`http://localhost`; traffic between your computer and the VPS is encrypted by
SSH. This must never be exposed directly through the Elastic IP.

## 3. Allow the runner to pull the private image

Create a GitHub personal access token **classic**, with **`read:packages`**,
for an account that can read this repository's GHCR package. Authorize company
SSO if required. On Ubuntu as the runner account (`ubuntu`), **without sudo**:

```bash
docker login ghcr.io --username YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME
```

At the password prompt enter the token, not your GitHub password. Do not put it
in a command-line argument or send it to chat. The workflow supplies the tested
image's immutable digest, so no image tag/password needs to go in `dev.env`.
See [GitHub's container-registry authentication instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry).

## 4. GitHub settings — leave automatic deployment off during preparation

Repository **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables**:

| Repository variable | Preparation value |
| --- | --- |
| `SALONOPS_TEST_DEPLOY_MODE` | `local-preview` |
| `SALONOPS_TEST_AUTODEPLOY` | `false` |
| `SALONOPS_PROD_AUTODEPLOY` | `false` |

The `testing` environment's selected deployment branch must be **`dev`**.
Do not add these values to Secrets or the server's `.env`.

When the runner label, directories, env permissions, registry login and SSH
firewall are ready, deliberately change **only** `SALONOPS_TEST_AUTODEPLOY` to
`true`. A subsequent `dev` push runs hosted tests, publishes the tested image,
then deploys on your runner. Nothing deploys merely because you installed a
runner or created an environment. Until ready, leave both switches false.

For the first deployment, make a normal `dev` commit/push, or ask the maintainer
to trigger it with an empty commit after checking the settings:

```powershell
git switch dev
git pull --ff-only origin dev
git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger private test deployment"
git push origin dev
```

Watch **GitHub → Actions → SalonOps checks and deployment**. Production remains
disabled and cannot select preview mode. Do not merge unreviewed changes into
`main`. To return to the secure test workflow later, set the test mode to `secure`
only after preparing its HTTPS and Restic configuration; this is not an automatic
database cutover. Keep preview backups/volume until a reviewed migration succeeds.

## 5. Open the site through an SSH tunnel

After a successful deployment, open **Windows PowerShell on your own computer**:

```powershell
ssh -i "C:\path\to\your-key.pem" -N -o ExitOnForwardFailure=yes -L 127.0.0.1:8000:127.0.0.1:8000 ubuntu@YOUR_ELASTIC_IP
```

Replace the key path and IP. Keep this terminal running; then open
**http://127.0.0.1:8000/login/** in your browser. `localhost:8000` also works.
The tunnel's local bind is deliberately `127.0.0.1`, not `0.0.0.0`. If local port
8000 is busy, use `127.0.0.1:8001:127.0.0.1:8000` and browse port 8001.
Verify the server's SSH host-key fingerprint through a trusted source before
accepting it. Do not bypass SSH host-key checks. Phone access requires its own
secure tunnel/VPN; this mode does not provide a public mobile URL.

Create the first account interactively on **Ubuntu** (no password in logs):

```bash
SALONOPS_IMAGE=$(cat /var/lib/salonops-dev/backups/salonops-dev.last-successful-image) \
docker compose --env-file /etc/salonops/dev.env -p salonops-dev \
  -f /opt/salonops-dev/compose.preview.yaml exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Use application administration to create test branches/staff and assign roles.
SOP workbook imports are separate from deployment; no real workbook or customer
database is uploaded automatically. No account password is stored in GitHub.

## 6. Local backups and restore practice

Every deployment validates its effective private Compose settings, checks the
restricted DB role, makes a PostgreSQL custom-format dump and validates it
**before migration**. It stops the old web app for schema changes and checks
migrations, `/health/` and `/login/` afterward. A second backup captures the
post-migration schema (important on the first, empty-database install).

Archives, SHA-256 checksums and release metadata stay in
`/var/lib/salonops-dev/backups/salonops-dev/<UTC timestamp>/`, outside the runner
checkout and Docker containers. No exports are uploaded to GitHub artifacts.
All local backups are retained: monitor disk use and deliberately remove old
ones only after retaining verified copies elsewhere. Deployment fails if the
disk is full or dump/archive validation fails. There is no automatic destructive
database rollback. If migration fails, the old web app may remain stopped;
investigate, don't delete the DB volume to fix it.

Manual backup after the first successful release, on Ubuntu:

```bash
bash /opt/salonops-dev/scripts/backup_preview.sh \
  /etc/salonops/dev.env salonops-dev /opt/salonops-dev/compose.preview.yaml \
  /var/lib/salonops-dev/backups
```

For an **isolated rehearsal**, choose a completed **post-migration** dump:

```bash
find /var/lib/salonops-dev/backups/salonops-dev -name database.dump
bash /opt/salonops-dev/scripts/restore_rehearsal.sh \
  /var/lib/salonops-dev/backups/salonops-dev/CHOSEN_TIMESTAMP/database.dump
```

It checks the checksum, restores into a temporary PostgreSQL container with
`--network none`, checks the application schema and removes **only that temporary
container**. It does not modify your live database. Restoring a live database
requires a separately reviewed downtime/cutover procedure.

Backups happen at deployment/manual execution, not every hour automatically.
If you add test data between releases, take a manual backup before important
tests or ask for a scheduled backup. To copy a completed dump and checksum to
your PC (Windows PowerShell, replace both placeholders):

```powershell
scp -i "C:\path\to\your-key.pem" ubuntu@YOUR_ELASTIC_IP:/var/lib/salonops-dev/backups/salonops-dev/CHOSEN_TIMESTAMP/database.dump* "$HOME\Downloads\"
```

Treat copies as confidential, store them on encrypted storage, and never inside
Git. Copying to another machine is a simple temporary alternative to S3, not a
managed encrypted off-site backup service with monitored retention.

## Troubleshooting

- Job skipped: verify the push was to `dev` and test opt-in is exactly `true`.
- Job queued: runner online and labeled `salonops-test`? Service using `ubuntu`?
- Registry denied: recheck package access, token `read:packages`, SSO and login
  as `ubuntu`, not root.
- Env permissions rejected: owner `ubuntu`, mode 600, outside Git.
- Browser cannot connect: successful deployment, SSH terminal still open, correct
  local port, security group permits your SSH source? Do **not** open port 8000.
- PostgreSQL auth failure: preserve the volume; investigate existing credentials.
- No disk space: safely archive verified old backups elsewhere; never run
  `docker compose down -v`, `docker volume prune` or `docker system prune --volumes`
  on this server.
