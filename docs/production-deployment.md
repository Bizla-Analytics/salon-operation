# SalonOps: test and production deployment

## What is ready, and what still needs company access

The application now requires PostgreSQL; there is no SQLite fallback. The
standalone production Compose stack runs the app and its **own PostgreSQL
container**, with a permanent named volume and a restricted application login.
They are separate containers, not a database baked into the app image.

CI tests on GitHub-hosted machines, publishes a tested image to GHCR, then
optionally deploys that exact image digest through a server-specific runner.
`dev` targets your test VPS; `main` targets the company VPS. Neither auto-deploy
job activates until its opt-in variable is set to `true`.

The two permanent branches are `dev` and `main`; `main` is GitHub's default
branch and contains approved production releases. Production still uses the
`production` environment, `salonops-production` runner label and
`SALONOPS_PROD_AUTODEPLOY` switch. Existing `/opt/salonops-prod`,
`/etc/salonops/prod.env`, backup paths, timer instance names and DB volume names
do **not** change when the branch changes. Never rename a DB volume to match a
Git branch. The retired `prod` branch is not needed.

This repository does not install a runner, issue a certificate, create a backup
bucket, configure GitHub protection rules, or change an existing server. The
company must approve and supply those first. Installing a runner once enables
normal code updates without repeated SSH access, but somebody must still handle
OS/Docker updates, runner maintenance, disk space, certificates and recovery.

## 1. Company checklist (one-time administrator work)

- Dedicated Linux x86-64 VPS with systemd, Docker Engine, Docker Compose plugin,
  Bash, coreutils and `flock`. This workflow expects Linux/X64, not Windows/ARM.
- A domain pointing to the VPS; decide who owns HTTPS and ports 80/443.
- Outbound access to GitHub, GHCR, Docker Hub and the backup storage endpoint.
- Company-controlled GHCR read access and encrypted off-server object storage.
- A deployment user (`salonops-deploy`), runner directory and permission to
  manage this stack. Do not share the production runner with untrusted projects.
- Firewall: expose only HTTPS/HTTP as appropriate; never publish PostgreSQL or
  port 8000 to the Internet. Restrict SSH using the company's policy.

**Important:** Docker socket/group access is effectively privileged server
access. A runner with it is not a harmless limited-access account. The company
must trust repository maintainers and reviewed workflow/script changes.
See [Docker's security warning](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/).
Keep the repo private; untrusted PR code must never run on the production VPS.

Company administrator (after approving the deployment user's privileges):

```bash
sudo install -d -o salonops-deploy -g salonops-deploy -m 700 /etc/salonops
sudo install -d -o salonops-deploy -g salonops-deploy -m 750 /opt/salonops-prod
sudo install -d -o salonops-deploy -g salonops-deploy -m 700 /var/lib/salonops-prod/backups
```

Use separate `salonops-dev` paths on the test server. Never reuse production
credentials, volumes, backup repository or real customer data on the test server.

## 2. Configuration and passwords

Copy `deploy/production.env.example` to `/etc/salonops/prod.env`, outside the
checkout. Replace **every placeholder**, especially the key, domain and three
database settings/passwords. Generate independent random values, for example:

```bash
python3 -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(64))'
```

- `SECRET_KEY`: unique to this environment; keep stable across normal releases.
- `POSTGRES_USER=salon_app`: restricted Django login, not the administrator.
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: application DB password.
- `POSTGRES_ADMIN_PASSWORD`: different bootstrap administrator password.
- `POSTGRES_VOLUME_NAME=salonops-prod-pgdata`: permanent name; never change it
  during ordinary deployments or you will appear to have an empty database.
- `ALLOWED_HOSTS`: actual hostname plus `localhost,127.0.0.1` for health checks.
- `CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS`: actual `https://` origin, no wildcards.
- `SALONOPS_IMAGE`: initial approved GHCR `@sha256:...` digest from CI.
- `SALONOPS_ENV_FILE`: supplied by scripts, not stored inside this file.

Protect configuration with mode 600, readable by the deployment user:

```bash
sudo chown salonops-deploy:salonops-deploy /etc/salonops/prod.env
sudo chmod 600 /etc/salonops/prod.env
```

The production web container receives only an explicit application-settings
allowlist; it does not receive the bootstrap admin or backup credentials.

DB initialization runs **only on an empty volume**. Changing passwords in the
env file does not update existing PostgreSQL roles. Coordinate a real password
rotation with a database administrator. Existing local development uses an
administrator DB role; do not reuse that role/volume for production. The new
stack creates `salonops_admin` for bootstrap and a non-superuser app role with
no CREATEDB, CREATEROLE or replication rights. It owns its application database
so it can run migrations. Only disposable CI uses CREATEDB for Django tests.

## 3. HTTPS: choose ONE option

### A. Company manages Nginx / another reverse proxy (default)

The company terminates TLS with a valid certificate and forwards to
`http://127.0.0.1:8000` on this VPS. It must preserve Host and **overwrite**, not
trust an incoming client-supplied `X-Forwarded-Proto` with its own TLS scheme.
Set `TRUST_PROXY_HEADERS=True` only after this is guaranteed. A proxy on a
different machine needs a company-designed private transport; do not simply
expose the backend publicly. Example when Nginx is the direct TLS terminator:

```nginx
location / {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
}
```

The company still configures its TLS server block, HTTP-to-HTTPS redirect and
certificate renewal. Leave `SALONOPS_USE_CADDY=false` in GitHub environment vars.

### B. Optional Caddy

If the company has **no** existing proxy and approves using ports 80/443, set
`SITE_DOMAIN`, `ACME_EMAIL`, and GitHub environment variable
`SALONOPS_USE_CADDY=true`. The deploy script adds `compose.caddy.yaml` and Caddy
handles TLS. DNS and public certificate validation must work first. Do not run
Caddy on ports already owned by another company service.

Both options use HTTPS redirects, secure session/CSRF cookies and SameSite Lax.
The private `/health/` endpoint alone permits HTTP for container checks. Start
with HSTS 300 seconds; increase after verifying HTTPS. Subdomain HSTS and browser
preload remain opt-in to avoid breaking other company sites. Their two Django
warnings are intentionally reported; `check_production_security` fails on other
deployment warnings. [Django proxy guidance](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.2/ref/settings/#secure-proxy-ssl-header).

## 4. Off-server backups: what they mean and setup

A Docker volume or a backup on the same VPS is **not** enough: both can disappear
with the server. `backup.sh` creates a consistent PostgreSQL custom-format dump,
validates its archive, writes a checksum and uploads it through encrypted Restic
to a **different** server/provider. Failed uploads fail the backup and block
deployment; the local dump remains available for diagnosis.

Create an HTTPS S3-compatible bucket (or HTTPS Restic REST server). Use a dedicated
repository/prefix per environment, bucket-scoped keys and a unique encryption
password. Copy `deploy/restic.env.example` to `/etc/salonops/prod.restic.env`.
For Docker env files use plain values, no shell quoting. chmod 600, same owner.
The password must also live in the company password manager: without it, encrypted
backups cannot be recovered. Store securely outside the VPS copies of deployment
configuration, domains, secrets and storage access instructions as well. DB dumps
do not include OS configuration or database role passwords. There are currently
no persistent customer-upload files; add a separate media backup if that changes.

Install reviewed operational files from the selected release into
`/opt/salonops-prod` with this structure: `compose.production.yaml`,
`compose.caddy.yaml`, `scripts/*.sh`, `deploy/Caddyfile`, `deploy/postgres/*.sh`.
All shell files must have Linux LF line endings (enforced by `.gitattributes`).
As the deployment user, initialize the new remote repository **once**:

```bash
bash /opt/salonops-prod/scripts/restic_admin.sh \
  /etc/salonops/prod.env salonops-prod /opt/salonops-prod/compose.production.yaml \
  /var/lib/salonops-prod/backups /etc/salonops/prod.restic.env init
```

Only HTTPS S3/REST endpoints are accepted by these scripts; the operator must
ensure the endpoint really is off-server. They never silently fall back to local
storage. Remote retention: last 5, daily 14, weekly 8, monthly 6; local successful
backups older than 7 days are removed. Failed uploads are retained locally and
need investigation, including disk-space monitoring.

## 5. GitHub and runner setup

1. In GitHub create environments **testing** and **production**, restrict their
   deployment branches to `dev` and `main` respectively. Protect both branches:
   require CI/reviews, block force pushes; production should require company
   approval. Review workflow, Compose and scripts via company CODEOWNERS. Some
   private-repository protection/approval features depend on the GitHub plan;
   verify availability rather than assuming they are enforced.
2. Repository **Settings → Actions → Runners → New self-hosted runner → Linux →
   x64**. Use GitHub's generated download/verification/registration commands,
   not a hard-coded runner version or token in Git. Add label `salonops-test` on
   your VPS and `salonops-production` on the company VPS. Keep default
   `self-hosted`, `Linux`, `X64` labels. Give each runner a distinct name.
3. Register as the deployment user, then have the administrator install/start
   the service from its runner directory:

   ```bash
   sudo ./svc.sh install salonops-deploy
   sudo ./svc.sh start
   sudo ./svc.sh status
   ```

   Confirm Online/Idle in GitHub. [Official runner setup](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/manage-runners/self-hosted-runners/add-runners),
   [service setup](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/manage-runners/self-hosted-runners/configure-the-application).
4. As that same user, perform `docker login ghcr.io` using company-owned
   read-packages credentials and stdin (not a token on the command line). The
   company grants access to the package. The CI `GITHUB_TOKEN` publishes the
   image; it is **not** a persistent server login. Protect Docker's credential
   store or configure a credential helper. Do not put credentials in workflows.
5. Keep `SALONOPS_TEST_AUTODEPLOY` and `SALONOPS_PROD_AUTODEPLOY` unset/false until
   the manual first-deployment and recovery checks pass. Then create repository
   Actions variables with those names and value `true`, separately. Set each
   environment's `SALONOPS_USE_CADDY` to `true` only for option B.

Runner labels and workflow branch conditions route jobs; **they are not a
security boundary** against someone able to edit workflows. Prefer company-owned
organization runner groups with approved-repository/workflow restrictions where
available. Do not accept untrusted PR workflows on this runner. Normal PR tests
in this workflow run only on GitHub-hosted machines and cannot deploy.

## 6. First release and normal updates

The first push to `dev`/`main` runs CI and publishes
`ghcr.io/bizla-analytics/salon-operation:<commit>`; find the immutable digest in
the publish log. Save it in the external env file. Manually deploy the approved
digest as the deployment user (optionally `export SALONOPS_USE_CADDY=true` first):

```bash
bash /opt/salonops-prod/scripts/deploy.sh \
  /etc/salonops/prod.env salonops-prod /opt/salonops-prod/compose.production.yaml \
  /var/lib/salonops-prod/backups /etc/salonops/prod.restic.env \
  ghcr.io/bizla-analytics/salon-operation@sha256:REPLACE_WITH_64_HEX_DIGEST \
  ghcr.io/bizla-analytics/salon-operation
```

Sequence: pull approved image → start DB → verify restricted role → successful
off-site backup → explicit migrations → start app → health/migration checks.
On the very first installation the pre-migration backup is an **empty database**.
Immediately take another backup after migrations and account setup, then rehearse
that backup before enabling timers/auto-deployment. Create a real administrator
with `manage.py createsuperuser` through the production Compose configuration;
never run `seed_demo` on production. Verify HTTPS login, all role dashboards,
service ordering, verification/invoice/feedback and secure cookies in a browser.

Once configured:

- Work locally on a feature branch → PR into `dev` → tests → your test VPS.
- Test with synthetic data → approved PR from `dev` into `main` → tests → company
  approval if configured → company VPS. Branches transfer **code**, not databases.
- Commit Django migrations alongside model changes. Use backwards-compatible
  expand/contract migrations; plan a write-maintenance window for incompatible
  changes. A backup does not make destructive migrations automatically safe.

No destructive automatic DB rollback is attempted. A previous app digest can
be redeployed only if compatible with the current schema; otherwise have the
company conduct a planned DB restore. Failed deployment does not mean DB
migrations have been undone. Never run `docker compose down -v` on either VPS.

## 7. Scheduled backups and restore rehearsal

Copy `deploy/ops.env.example` to `/etc/salonops/prod.ops.env`, adjust paths and
ownership as above. Install the four reviewed `deploy/systemd/*` files into
`/etc/systemd/system/`. As administrator, after the first post-migration backup:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start salonops-backup@prod.service
sudo systemctl start salonops-rehearsal@prod.service
sudo systemctl enable --now salonops-backup@prod.timer salonops-rehearsal@prod.timer
systemctl list-timers 'salonops-*'
journalctl -u salonops-backup@prod.service -u salonops-rehearsal@prod.service
```

Repeat separately for `dev` if desired. Hourly backups give a target of roughly
one hour of possible data loss when jobs succeed; delays/failures can increase
that. Weekly Sunday UTC rehearsal downloads the latest encrypted remote snapshot,
verifies files, restores into a newly generated isolated PostgreSQL container,
checks core tables, and removes only that temporary container/anonymous volume.
It never connects to or mounts the live DB. Repository check and prune follow a
successful rehearsal. This proves archive recoverability, not a full end-user
disaster recovery exercise; also test app login/workflows on an isolated rebuilt
server periodically and measure how long recovery takes.

**Monitoring is required:** timers/journal are not email/SMS alerts. Company
monitoring should alert on failed units, missing recent snapshots, disk usage,
HTTPS expiry and `/health/` failures. Test the alert path; investigate any failed
weekly rehearsal. Keep independent recovery access if GitHub is unavailable.

Manual download-and-rehearse (same five arguments as `backup.sh`):

```bash
bash /opt/salonops-prod/scripts/rehearse_offsite.sh \
  /etc/salonops/prod.env salonops-prod /opt/salonops-prod/compose.production.yaml \
  /var/lib/salonops-prod/backups /etc/salonops/prod.restic.env
```

## 8. Moving to a new VPS / importing an existing PostgreSQL database

1. Provision new Docker/TLS/configuration and a **new** permanent DB volume with
   the restricted app account. Use the same application release/schema version.
2. Rehearse recovery from off-site first. For cutover, stop customer/staff writes
   on the old server and take a final successful dump + encrypted upload. Copy
   backups only through approved secure paths outside Git; never CI artifacts.
3. Restore only into the verified **empty new target**. PostgreSQL `pg_restore
   --exit-on-error --no-owner --no-acl` as the target app owner avoids importing
   old superuser ownership/privileges. Retain production secrets securely. Do not
   restore over a running live database or use `--clean` casually.
4. Run migrations/security/health checks, compare aggregate counts, validate
   visits/tasks/timing/invoices/feedback and role isolation. Change DNS/proxy
   routing after approval, re-enable writes on only the new server, then enable
   its runner and backup timers. Keep the old server read-only for a rollback
   window; preserve backups before decommissioning it.

No workbook is needed for daily operations or restoring historical work. Import
master-data changes deliberately; existing visit task snapshots must remain
unchanged. Never put workbooks, DB dumps, customers or `.env` into Git.

## Validation boundary

Local automated tests exercise PostgreSQL, production settings, proxy redirects,
secure cookies, backup failure ordering and rehearsal isolation. Real remote
upload, VPS certificates, runner registration, GitHub approvals and disaster
cutover require the actual company infrastructure and credentials; do not treat
them as completed just because scripts are present.
